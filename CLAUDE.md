## Design Context

### Users
- **Recruiters & hiring managers** evaluating Ray for senior/executive engineering roles or contracts
- **Potential clients** considering Shadow Software LLC for engineering engagements
- Both audiences arrive expecting credibility, clarity, and proof of serious experience

### Brand Personality
- **Understated, authoritative, precise** — Swiss-design inspired minimalism
- Emotional goals: instant credibility, quiet confidence, respect for the visitor's time
- Ray is a founder/CEO with deep technical roots — the site should reflect someone who builds real things

### Ventures & CTAs
- Ray is the founder of **AmericanGuntrader.com** and **DabDash.com**
- CTAs should feel organic and contextual, not salesy — integrated naturally into the resume narrative

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Minimal & refined** — restrained palette, generous whitespace, typographic hierarchy does the heavy lifting
- Light and dark modes via `prefers-color-scheme`, both equally considered
- Design tokens: `--accent: #2d4a7a` (light) / `#8ab0e2` (dark), `--bg: #f5f4f0` / `#141416`

### Anti-References (what this must NOT look like)
- Generic LinkedIn profile (headshot + timeline + endorsements)
- Developer portfolio template (dark mode, terminal aesthetic, card grids)
- Corporate consulting site (stock photos, blue gradients, buzzwords)
- Flashy startup landing page (hero sections, CTAs everywhere, animated illustrations)

### Design Principles
1. **Typography is the design** — hierarchy, weight, and spacing carry the visual identity
2. **Earned density** — information-rich but never cluttered; every element justifies its presence
3. **Quiet authority** — the design should feel like it was made by someone who doesn't need to prove anything
4. **Dual-purpose clarity** — a recruiter and a potential client should both find what they need within seconds
5. **Contextual commerce** — ventures and CTAs are woven into the narrative, never bolted on
